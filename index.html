	<p>I'm a Los Angeles native born and raised just 20 min outside of Los Angeles, I grew up in the San Gabriel Valley in a City called Covina. I attended Cal Poly Pomona with a Bachelors in Business Marketing with an emphasis on Product and Brand Management.  I'm an avid reader usually read about 10 to 15 books a year. My latest book I cant put down is Tool of Titans by Tim Ferris. I love cinema, with great dialogue, I'm constatly watching youtube videos that breakdown movies to show how they work and how the directors created the storyline. I love Real Estate, I work with investors in LA buying homes that need repair and making them into masterpieces once again. Something about making something brand new again is very exciting. I love to see things getting built!  My biggest and most rewarding job now is raising my son Maximilian, who is a handful at two years old. My wife and I our ejoying our lives creating it as we always imagined working hard, traveling to destinations every year taking in life and making life long memories.</p>
